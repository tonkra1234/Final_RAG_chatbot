Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for chatbots using Langchain and Huggingfac to retrieve the informations from the documents. The structure and components will be discussed to clearer understand about RAG chatbot.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) currently combines the Information Retrieval and Generative models to provide a higher level of artificial intelligence application. The Information Retrieval search through databases to find relevant information and Generative models is capable of dynamically generating human-like answers.

### Information Retrieval (IR)

    To create an external knowledge base, information retrieval is necessary. Knowledge Base plays a crucial role as a place where the information is stored and fed to the system. The storage of semantically relevant information is known as a vector database. A vector database stores vectors representing the information encoded by machine learning models.  These models known as Embedding can convert and encode passages into vector space by vectorisation technique.

    The ‘hallucination’ problem of the LLMs is eliminated because of the additional source knowledge (fed directly into the model) or Information Retrieval (IR). These combinations improve the reliability of the information and capability of chatbots.
