However the vehicle, which was carrying the Nahid-1 satellite, failed to put the payload in orbit.\nOn 7 March, JAXA/MHI H3's maiden flight was terminated in-flight due to failure to ignite the second stage, resulting in the loss of the ALOS-3 land observation satellite.\nOn 23 March, Relativity Space's Terran 1 had its debut flight. The flight goal, which was to demonstrate the viability of 3D printing for major structural components of a rocket, was achieved when Terran 1 passed max q and continued to perform nominally. However, after stage separation, the second stage failed to ignite, ending the mission. Following the failed launch, Relativity retired the rocket in favor of developing the much larger, reusable Terran R vehicle.\nOn 2 April, Space Pioneer's Tianlong-2 had its debut flight, and successfully reached orbit. It was the first successful launch of a Chinese privately-funded liquid-fueled rocket. Space Pioneer is the first private company to reach orbit on its first attempt using a fully liquid fueled rocket.\nOn 20 April, SpaceX's Starship had its first test flight, aiming to complete about three-quarters of an orbit and landing in the Pacific Ocean northwest of Kauai. Several engines on the booster failed during the flight and the flight termination system was triggered, ending the flight before stage separation.\nOn 22 April, Evolution Space completed its first suborbital space flight test with the Gold Chain Cowboy solid-fueled rocket.\nOn 30 May, the North Korean Chollima-1 made its first orbital launch attempt, carrying the military reconnaissance satellite Malligyong-1. However, the launch failed to achieve orbit when the second stage ignited too early in the mission. The launch vehicle crashed into the Yellow Sea.\nOn 12 July, LandSpace's Zhuque-2 rocket, in its second flight, became the world's first methane-fuelled rocket to successfully reach orbit.\nOn 5 September, the sea-launched version of the Ceres-1 launch vehicle, designated Ceres-1S, made its successful debut.\nOn 15 September, the Firefly Alpha made its successful flight for a tactically responsive mission for the U.S. Space Force.\nOn November 18, 2023, SpaceX Starship attempted its second flight test, becoming the heaviest rocket to enter space, although the first stage exploded shortly after separation, while the second stage was lost nearly eight minutes after launch. In the same month, they completed the construction of crew access tower at CCSFS SLC-40 launch pad, where they completed 50 launches alone on that launch pad. They also completed 250th Falcon booster landing.\nIn December 2023, USA broke the world record of most launches by a nation (108), held by Soviet Union in 1982. In the same month, they completed 200th successful Falcon booster autonomous spaceport droneship landing.\n\n\n=== Satellite technology ===\nOn January 27, ESA reported the successful demonstration of a braking sail-based satellite deorbiter, ADEO, which could be used by space debris mitigation measures.\nIn April, Chinese media first reported on tests of flexible organic solar cells on balloons in the 35 km stratosphere.\nOn 29 July a Falcon Heavy rocket launched the Jupiter-3 (EchoStar-24) communications satellite to geosynchronous orbit.
